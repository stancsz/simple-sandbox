# Simple Biosphere Technical Specification

## Core Architecture
The system consists of independent MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers communicating with an Orchestrator/Daemon loop. Each server isolates domains (e.g., Brain, HR, Scheduler, Business Ops).

At the macro level, the architecture functions as a **Digital Biosphere**—a multi-agency ecosystem. A "root agency" operates autonomously and can spawn, merge, or retire "child agencies" through the `Agency Orchestrator MCP` to adapt to workload demands dynamically.

This ecosystem is supported by a **Hyper-Scaling Engine** that manages high-scale orchestration, enforces cost budgets, and dynamically allocates compute resources. Deployments leverage **Multi-Region High Availability** (via Kubernetes) with automated failover and geographic load balancing to ensure continuous operational resilience against regional outages.

## LLM System & Batching
The LLM engine (`src/llm.ts`) provides unified provider routing with an integrated caching layer (`llm_cache_hit`) and persona injection.

### Batch Prompt Consolidation (Phase 28)
Routine tasks scheduled via `scheduler.json` tagged with `is_routine: true` bypass immediate individual execution. The `BatchExecutor` queues these tasks grouped by company tenant. Once a maximum batch size (`maxBatchSize: 5`) is hit, or a 5-minute window expires, the engine consolidates them into a single meta-prompt (`BatchPromptBuilder`). This single LLM call processes all queued tasks simultaneously, returning a structured JSON array. This system achieves a **~60-70% reduction** in input prompt tokens by deduplicating the large strategic system instructions.

## Scheduling Engine
Tasks are defined in `scheduler.json`. The `Scheduler` daemon (`src/scheduler.ts`) monitors Cron schedules and File Watchers.
- Routine tasks (`is_routine: true`) -> `BatchExecutor.enqueue(task)`
- Normal tasks -> `JobDelegator.delegateTask(task)`

## Storage
- **Episodic Memory**: LanceDB vector database (`.agent/lancedb`) for history and semantic RAG.
- **Semantic Graph**: NetworkX-like graph mapping entities and dependencies.

## 17. Zero-Token Operations Architecture (Phase 29)
Phase 29 introduces the Symbolic Engine, transitioning the system from token-heavy LLM deliberations to deterministic, zero-cost task executions.

### Core Components
1. **Symbolic Engine (`src/symbolic/`)**:
   - **`TaskGraph`**: A JSON-serializable workflow definition that bypasses LLM inference.
   - **Rule Engine**: Evaluates business logic and conditionals (e.g., `if deal_amount > 10000`) deterministically.
   - **Symbolic Compiler**: Ingests successful past episodes from the Brain, extracts invariants using a lightweight LLM, and compiles them into a `TaskGraph`.

## 18. Time-Series Forecasting Architecture (Phase 29)
Phase 29 introduces a dedicated `forecasting` MCP server designed to ingest historical metric data and provide future predictions to support capacity planning, node scaling, and budget management.

### Core Components
1. **Time-Series Storage**: Uses `better-sqlite3` within the `.agent/data/forecasting.db` directory. Data is stored in a structured `metrics` table with strict multi-tenant isolation via a `company` index.
2. **Statistical Modeling Engine**: Uses `simple-statistics` to run linear regressions on historical data points. It outputs predicted values over a specified horizon (in days) and includes expanding confidence bounds and R-squared confidence scoring.
3. **Integration**: The `business_ops` MCP uses the `forecast_resource_demand` tool to act as a client to the `forecasting` server, tying strategic modeling directly into the operational resource planning pipeline.

### Integration with the 4 Pillars
- **Brain Integration**: The `compile_to_symbolic` tool allows the HR Loop or Supervisor to permanently "bake" highly successful patterns into zero-token graphs.
- **Adaptive Router**: The `AdaptiveRouter` intercepts `generate` calls. If a compiled `TaskGraph` matches the intent, it executes deterministically, logging an `llm_requests_avoided` metric and reducing token costs by >40% for routine operations.

## 20. Ecosystem Intelligence & Meta-Learning (Phases 34 & 35)
Phases 34 and 35 introduce the capability for the ecosystem to learn from its collective experiences and apply these insights globally to improve operational efficiency and decision-making.

### Core Components
1. **analyze_ecosystem_patterns (Brain MCP)**:
   - Queries historical execution data and metrics across the entire agency ecosystem.
   - Synthesizes findings using the LLM to identify inefficiencies, successful configurations, and emerging systemic trends.
   - Outputs a formalized `ecosystem_policy` detailing recommended parameter adjustments (e.g., optimal concurrency, token thresholds).
2. **apply_ecosystem_insights (Agency Orchestrator MCP)**:
   - Retrieves the latest `ecosystem_policy` from the Brain's episodic memory.
   - Parses the recommended parameter changes and dynamically updates the configurations (e.g., swarm budgets, timeouts) of targeted or all child agencies.

## 21. Production Ecosystem Observability & Governance (Phase 37)
Phase 37 introduces the `EcosystemAuditor` MCP and enhances the Brain MCP to synthesize cross-agency communications, policy changes, and morphology adjustments into actionable audit reports.

### Core Components
1. **generate_ecosystem_audit_report (Brain MCP)**:
   - Queries the `EcosystemAuditor` MCP server to fetch recent logs.
   - Uses the LLM to synthesize raw logs into a structured markdown report detailing Key Decisions, Policy Deviations, Resource Allocation Anomalies, and Recommendations.
   - Stores the generated report in the Brain's episodic memory for long-term governance and compliance tracking.

## 19. Corporate Consciousness & Strategic Decision Engine (Phase 30)
Phase 30 introduces an autonomous strategic decision loop, elevating the system from merely forecasting future states to automatically adjusting corporate strategy, operational policies, and Swarm initiatives.

### Core Components
1. **Strategic Decision Engine (`make_strategic_decision`)**:
   - Ingests predictive data from the `forecasting` MCP alongside the current `CorporateStrategy` (stored in `EpisodicMemory`).
   - Uses the LLM (acting as CEO) to evaluate whether a strategic pivot is required (e.g., expanding cloud capacity due to a predicted CPU shortage).
   - Generates a "confidence score". If the score exceeds `0.80`, the engine automatically modifies the corporate strategy baseline.

2. **Executive Execution (`execute_strategic_initiative`)**:
   - Translates high-level strategic pivots into specific, actionable parameters.
   - Automatically calculates updates for the Operating Policy (e.g., altering `base_pricing_multiplier` or `max_fleet_size`).
   - Connects to the Linear API to generate prioritized trackable issues for the Swarm Fleet or Human Supervisors.

### Integration with the 4 Pillars
- **Recursive Optimization**: By combining Time-Series Forecasting (Phase 29) with the Strategic Decision Engine (Phase 30), the agent continuously aligns its resource allocation, pricing models, and operational footprint with predicted market realties, reducing latency in C-suite decision-making to near-zero.
