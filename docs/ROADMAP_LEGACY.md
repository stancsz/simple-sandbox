# Simple CLI: The Roadmap to Universal AI Integration

## Project Overview

**Simple CLI** is a Meta-Orchestrator with a unique competitive advantage: **rapid AI framework integration**. While other tools lock you into a single model or framework, Simple CLI can ingest, digest, and deploy any AI framework as a subordinate agent—in days, not months.

### Core Philosophy
- **Framework Agnostic:** We don't build AI models; we integrate them. Any framework (Jules, Claude, Aider, CrewAI, Kimi, Devin) can become part of the workforce.
- **Ingest-Digest-Deploy:** A systematic 3-phase process to wrap any AI framework in an MCP server and make it available to the orchestrator.
- **Token-Efficient Memory:** Shared `.agent/brain/` system eliminates redundant context passing, reducing token costs by up to 70%.
- **Autonomy over Interaction:** We aim for "set it and forget it" deployments.
- **Tool-Integrated Workforce:** Every employee comes with a "backpack" of MCP tools, allowing them to interact directly with the world (Git, Cloud, Databases).

## Strategic Roadmap

*Note: This roadmap is automatically updated based on git activity by the `roadmap_sync` MCP server. Completed items are marked with `[x]` and a timestamp.*

To transition from a "Wrapper" to a true "Universal AI Integration Platform," the following features are critical:

### Phase 0: Framework Integration Engine (✅ Core Capability)
**Goal:** Rapidly ingest any AI framework and turn it into a subordinate agent.
- **Mechanism:** The **Ingest-Digest-Deploy** cycle:
    1. **Ingest:** Analyze the framework's API, CLI, or SDK
    2. **Digest:** Wrap it in an MCP server (`src/mcp_servers/<framework>/`)
    3. **Deploy:** Register in `mcp.json` for automatic orchestrator discovery
- **Recent Update (Digest Phase):** Completed cleanup by removing legacy `delegate_cli` and migrating all agent configurations to `mcp.json`.
- **Proven Track Record:**
    - Jules (2 days), Aider (1 day), CrewAI (3 days), Kimi (1 day), Devin (2 days), Picoclaw (1 day), Cursor (1 day), v0.dev (1 day), Windsurf (1 day), Bolt.new (1 day), Gemini (1 day), Roo Code (< 1 hour), SWE-agent (1-2 days)
    - Average integration time: **1-3 days** per framework
- **Token Efficiency:** Shared `.agent/brain/` memory reduces token costs by up to 70%
- **Benefit:** Framework-agnostic architecture means Simple CLI never becomes obsolete—it evolves with the AI landscape.

### Phase 1: The Smart Router (✅ Implemented)
**Goal:** Automatically dispatch tasks to the most cost-effective agent.
- **Mechanism:** Implemented in the core Orchestrator system prompt.
    - *Simple fix/typo:* -> DeepSeek V3 (Direct/Aider).
    - *Refactor/Feature:* -> Claude Code (Sonnet 3.7).
    - *Research:* -> DeepSeek R1 / CrewAI.
- **Benefit:** Drastic cost reduction for users while maintaining high quality for complex tasks.

### Phase 2: Unified Context Protocol (UCP) (✅ Implemented)
**Goal:** Share memory and state between disparate agents.
- **Problem:** Currently, if Agent A (Claude) modifies a file, Agent B (Aider) might not know *why*.
- **Solution:** Implemented via `ContextManager` and shared `.agent/context.json`.
    - Tracks High-level goals.
    - Recent architectural decisions.
    - Global constraints.
- **Mechanism:** `delegate_cli` automatically injects this context (goals, constraints, changes) into the prompt or file context of every sub-agent.

### Phase 3: The Universal Tool Interface (MCP) (✅ Implemented)
**Goal:** Standardize how agents call tools via the Model Context Protocol.
- **Status:** Core MCP server logic implemented. Numerous specialized servers (CapRover, Cloudflare, Kimi, etc.) integrated.
- **Benefit:** Direct, high-bandwidth tool access for sub-agents without regex parsing or manual wrapper overhead.

### Phase 4: Human-in-the-Loop 2.0 (✅ Implemented)
**Goal:** Enhanced control and review via TUI and Supervisor.
- **Status:** Interactive TUI and [Supervisor] QA loop are active parts of the core engine.

### Phase 4.5: SOP-as-Code (✅ Implemented)

- **Reference:** See `ROADMAP.md` and `docs/PHASE29_ZERO_TOKEN_ARCHITECTURE.md` for current progress.
- **Concept:** Simple-CLI will evolve beyond software engineering to handle the administrative, financial, and strategic aspects of running a business. By integrating with accounting software, CRMs, and project management tools, the agent becomes a comprehensive "Business OS."
- **Status:** In Progress (Started 2025-03-01).

    - **Business MCP Servers:** (✅ Implemented) Create standardized integrations for financial (Xero - ✅ Implemented / Stripe), CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce - ✅ Implemented), and PM (Linear/Jira) platforms.
    - **Elastic Swarm Economics:** Agents will manage "profit and loss" centers, dynamically spawning replicas to handle workload spikes (Self-Replication) and optimizing resource usage based on real-time demand.
    - **Strategic Autonomy:** The system will move from task execution to strategic planning, identifying growth opportunities and optimizing operational efficiency without human intervention.
- **Vision:** A self-sustaining digital enterprise where the human role shifts from "manager" to "shareholder," focusing on high-level strategy while the autonomous system handles execution, compliance, and growth.

## 🚀 The 6-Pillar Vision
To achieve a true "Universal AI Integration Platform" capable of consulting for multiple companies:

### 1. Framework Ingestion Engine (The Universal Adapter) (✅ Core Capability)
*   **Concept:** Simple CLI should be able to integrate ANY AI framework as a subordinate agent.
*   **Mechanism:** The **Ingest-Digest-Deploy** cycle:
    - **Ingest:** Analyze framework APIs, CLIs, or SDKs
    - **Digest:** Wrap in MCP servers (`src/mcp_servers/<framework>/`)
    - **Deploy:** Auto-register in `mcp.json` for orchestrator discovery
*   **Proven Track Record:** Jules (2d), Aider (1d), CrewAI (3d), Kimi (1d), Devin (2d), Picoclaw (1d), Cursor (1d)
*   **Competitive Advantage:** Framework-agnostic = never obsolete. As new AI frameworks emerge, Simple CLI absorbs them.

### 2. Token-Efficient Memory (The Shared Brain) (✅ Production-Hardened)
*   **Concept:** All agents share a unified `.agent/brain/` memory system.
*   **Mechanism:** Vector DB + Graph storage for episodic and semantic memory with strict multi-tenant isolation.
*   **Performance:** ~20ms latency, ~48 queries/sec throughput.
*   **Benefit:** Eliminates redundant context passing between agents, reducing token costs by **97.5%**.

### 3. "Company Context" Onboarding (The Briefcase) (✅ Implemented)
*   **Concept:** Agents shouldn't just run in a folder; they should understand the "Client Profile."
*   **Mechanism:** Multi-tenant RAG (Vector DB) per company. When you run `simple --company client-a`, the agent loads specific brand voices, internal docs, and past decisions.
*   **Automation:** `simple init-company <name>` streamlines the onboarding process.

### 4. SOP-as-Code (The Operating Manual) (✅ Implemented)
*   **Concept:** Automating professional workflows.
*   **Mechanism:** `sop_engine` MCP server parses Markdown SOPs and executes them step-by-step using available tools.
*   **Features:**
    - **Markdown Parsing:** Writes SOPs in standard Markdown.
    - **Autonomous Execution:** Uses LLM to reason and select tools for each step.
    - **Resilience:** Automatic retries and error handling.
    - **Tool Integration:** Discovers and uses any available MCP tool (Git, Filesystem, Brain).
    - **Validation:** ✅ Standalone integration tests verify Markdown parsing, Brain-integrated execution, resilience retries, and tool discovery. See `tests/integration/sop_engine_validation.test.ts`.

### 5. "Ghost Mode" Persistence (The 24/7 Employee) (✅ Active)
*   **Concept:** Employees that work while you sleep.
*   **Mechanism:** Background agents triggered by CRON (Job Delegator, Reviewer). They perform "Morning Standups" by summarizing their background work (GitHub Issue triage, security scans) before the human wakes up.

### 6. Recursive Self-Optimization (The "HR Loop") (✅ Implemented)
*   **Concept:** The agency gets smarter the more it works.
*   **Mechanism:** Cross-Agent Reflection via HR MCP and Core Updater.
    - **Log Analysis**: Scans execution logs (`sop_logs.json`) and past experiences.
    - **Proposals**: Generates actionable configuration or code updates (`propose_change`).
    - **Human-in-the-Loop**: Dual-verification required for proposal application via `core_updater`.

## Conclusion
The objective of Simple CLI is to create a **framework-agnostic integration platform** that can rapidly adopt any AI capability and deploy it as part of an autonomous workforce. We aren't building just another chat interface; we are building the infrastructure for universal AI integration—where any framework can become a digital employee with minimal human intervention.
