# Company Context (The Briefcase)

The "Briefcase" system allows agents to load client-specific contexts, ensuring that work for one client is isolated from another and informed by the client's specific guidelines, documents, and history.

## Architecture

The system is built around the **Company Context MCP Server** (`src/mcp_servers/company_context.ts`) which manages a dedicated `lancedb` vector database for each company.

### Directory Structure

Data is stored in `.agent/companies/{company_id}/`:

-   `docs/`: Raw documents (Markdown, Text) to be ingested.
-   `brain/`: The LanceDB vector database storing embeddings of the documents.
-   `config.json`: (Optional) Metadata like Brand Voice.

### Components

1.  **CLI Flag**: `simple --company client-a` sets the context.
2.  **Environment Variable**: `JULES_COMPANY` tracks the active company.
3.  **MCP Server**: Exposes tools to ingest and query company data.
4.  **Orchestrator**: Automatically injects relevant company context into the prompt using RAG.

## Usage

### 1. Quick Start: Adding a New Company

The recommended way to onboard a new company is using the `onboard-company` command, which automates the setup of the entire 6-Pillar environment:

```bash
simple onboard-company acme-corp
```

This command runs an automated SOP that:
1.  Initializes the company context (directories, config).
2.  Seeds the Brain (episodic memory).
3.  Creates sample SOPs.
4.  Schedules Ghost Mode agents (Job Delegator, Reviewer).
5.  Enables the HR Loop.
6.  Validates the setup and generates a report.

Alternatively, you can use the basic initialization command:

```bash
simple init-company acme-corp
```

This interactive command will only:
1.  Create the directory structure in `.agent/companies/acme-corp/`.
2.  Prompt you for basic details (Brand Voice, Goals, Tech Stack).
3.  Generate a `company_context.json` file.
4.  Initialize a fresh LanceDB vector store for the company.
5.  Register the company in `.agent/config.json`.

Alternatively, you can manually create the structure:
```bash
mkdir -p .agent/companies/acme-corp/docs
```
And add documents (e.g., `brand_guidelines.md`) to this folder.

### 2. Run with Context

```bash
simple --company acme-corp
```
On startup, the agent will:
1.  Load the company profile.
2.  Filter memory and queries to `acme-corp`.

### 3. Ingest Documents

You can ask the agent:
> "Ingest the company documents."

The agent will use the `load_company_context` tool to scan `.agent/companies/acme-corp/docs`, embed the content, and store it in the vector DB.

### 4. Querying

The agent automatically queries this database when you ask questions, injecting relevant chunks into the conversation.

### 5. Multi-Tenant Interfaces

For Slack and Teams interfaces, you can specify the company context dynamically in your message using the `--company` flag:

> @bot Hello --company client-a

This isolates the session to the specified company without restarting the server.

## Tools

-   `load_company_context(company_id)`: Ingests documents from the docs folder.
-   `query_company_context(query, company_id)`: Searches the vector database.
-   `list_companies()`: Lists available companies.

## Testing

The company context feature is validated by a comprehensive test suite:

1.  **Context Isolation**: `tests/company_context_integration.test.ts` verifies that `ContextServer` maintains separate context files for each company and that `ContextManager` queries the Brain MCP with the correct company ID.
2.  **Interface Integration**: `tests/interface_integration.test.ts` verifies that Slack and Teams adapters correctly parse the `--company` flag and pass it to the agent engine.
3.  **Vector Database**: Integration tests confirm that `CompanyContextServer` ingests and queries documents from isolated `lancedb` instances for each company.

## Brain-Backed Memory Architecture

The Company Context system is fully integrated with the **Brain MCP Server** to provide deep, persistent memory with enterprise-grade concurrency guarantees.

### Concurrency & Data Integrity

To support high-concurrency multi-tenant environments (e.g., Kubernetes), the Brain employs a robust three-layer protection strategy:

1.  **Connection Pooling (LanceConnector)**:
    -   Implements a singleton pattern with promise-based locking to prevent race conditions during initial database connection.
    -   Ensures efficient resource usage across thousands of operations.

2.  **File-Based Locking (proper-lockfile)**:
    -   **Episodic Memory**: Cross-process file locking ensures that simultaneous writes to the LanceDB vector store from different pods or processes do not corrupt data.
    -   **Semantic Graph**: Graph updates (`addNode`, `addEdge`) are protected by file locks, forcing a reload of data from disk to guarantee freshness and prevent overwrites.
    -   **Retry Logic**: Built-in exponential backoff handles contention gracefully.

3.  **In-Process Synchronization (Async Mutex)**:
    -   Fine-grained mutexes handle thread safety within a single Node.js process, reducing the overhead of file locking for local operations.

### Validation
These guarantees are validated by `tests/integration/brain_production.test.ts`, which simulates 12+ concurrent tenants performing hundreds of parallel reads and writes with zero data loss or cross-contamination.

## Meta-Learning Integration

The Company Context integrates meta-learning insights derived from ecosystem patterns. The `update_company_with_ecosystem_insights` tool retrieves company attributes, analyzes ecosystem patterns through the Brain MCP filtered by these attributes, and stores the personalized insights into the company's context (as `meta_learning_insight`). These insights are then automatically included when loading the company context, enabling personalized client optimization that overrides or complements general ecosystem policies.
